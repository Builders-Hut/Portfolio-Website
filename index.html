          I love building things from scratch. Imagine a world where all the
          hardware that you use was sourced and built by yourself. That's the
          world I want to live in. As a part of a special team dedicated to
          robotics in my college, I hope to develop my skills further and take
          part in competitions around the world.

        <span>
          Programming feels like magic to me. It gives me the freedom to explore
          and build my own world with only my imagination as a limit. I hope to
          be able to make a product that helps easen the lives of people that
          use it and be able to make a difference in the world.

        <span>
          The rush of emotions i feel when I am on stage, talking to a crowd is
          something I can not explain. Seeing everyone's eyes on me, listening
          to my every word and so much more gives me more adrenaline than any
          thing in the world. I hope to one day be able to address the people if
          only for a moment.
